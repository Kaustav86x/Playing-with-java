To run a Java Program on your computer using Notepad and Command Prompt, follow the steps ---- 
1. First of all, install JDK on your machine. 
   (https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)
2. Set the path to the environment variables.
3. Write the code on Notepad and save the file by the name of the class.
4. Open cmd and go to the location where the file is and run the command : 
   (javac the_name_of_the_file.java)
   (Note: NEVER FOREGT TO SAVE THE FILE WITH A .java EXTENSION !!!!! )
6. The javac command reads source files that contain module, package and type declarations written in the Java programming language, 
and compiles them into "class" files that run on the Java Virtual Machine. 
5. Once the class file is created, run this command ---
   (java the_name_of_the_file)
   
   If everything goes right, you can see the output.
