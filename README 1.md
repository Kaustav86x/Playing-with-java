Core concepts of Java, starting from the very basics (Suppose from printing "Hello World" 😁) 

NOTE: In the latest version of jdk, java class file need not to be created in order to run a java code. Just type the following command :
(location_where_you_have_saved_the_java_file_/java name_of_the_file.java)

(Example: C:\Users\Kaustav\OneDrive\Documents\Java Programms>java Test_case_2.java)
