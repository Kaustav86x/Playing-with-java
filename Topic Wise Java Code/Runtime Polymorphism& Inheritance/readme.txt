What is Inheritance ?

= > In OOP(Object Oriented Programming), the concept of Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties ( attributes and methods ) of another class.  

Child Class : The class that inherits the properties of another class is called the SubClass or the Child class. 
Parent Class : The class from which the properties are inherited from is the Superclass or parent class.


What is Polymorphism ?

=> Polymorphism in OOP is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.

Ex: '+' is a mathematical operator (2 + 3 = 5)
    '+' is also used to concat strings in Java.
    

What is Runtime Polymorphism ?

=> The concept of Runtime Polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is better understandable with an example.
Suppose, a class named Dog has been created. Another class named Bulldog has been inherited from the class Dog. The child class has override the parent class method.
Now, we are calling the method by the refernce variable of the parent class. Since, the child class has override the method of the parent class, the subclass
method invoked at the runtime and not the parent class method. 
This concept is know as Runtime Polymorphism.
